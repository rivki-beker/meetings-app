# Business Management Website

This project is designed for managing a small business, such as a consultancy or salon. It includes two main components:

1. **Backend**: A Node.js server for managing business data and appointments.
2. **Frontend**: A React application built with Vite for the client-side interface.

## Project Structure

The repository contains:

- `reactProjectServer/` - Node.js backend project
- `meetings-project/` - React + Vite client-side project

## Backend (Node.js)

The backend handles API requests related to business data and appointments.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `reactProjectServer` directory:
   ```bash
   cd reactProjectServer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /login` - Authenticate a user with `name` and `password`. Returns `200` for valid credentials (`name: "admin"`, `password: "123456"`), otherwise returns `401`.
- `POST /appointment` - Add a new appointment. Checks for appointment availability. Returns `200` if successful, otherwise returns `400` if the time is not available.
- `GET /appointments` - Retrieve a list of all scheduled appointments.
- `POST /service` - Add a new service. Returns `200` if successful, otherwise returns `400` if the service already exists.
- `GET /services` - Retrieve a list of all services.
- `POST /businessData` - Add or update business details. Returns the updated business data.
- `PUT /businessData` - Update business details. Returns the updated business data.
- `GET /businessData` - Retrieve business details.

## Frontend (React + Vite)

The client-side application allows users to interact with business data and schedule appointments.

   ```bash

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
